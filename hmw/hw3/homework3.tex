%\section{$K$ means clustering and $K$ nearest neighbors classification}
\begin{problem}{$K$-Means Clustering [65 points]}
In this problem, you will explore and attempt to solve a realistic machine learning problem. 
The \href{https://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction/data}{Porto Seguro dataset} includes a number of anonymized features of vehicle drivers collected over the course of a year, as well as a target flag indicating whether the driver filled an insurance claim during the year.
Your task is to predict whether a driver will fill an insurance claim given their feature vector. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item {[10 points]} 
    Data analysis is an important first step. Proceed to explore this problem's dataset by addressing the following:
    \begin{enumerate}
            \item What are the dimensions of the training and testing datasets?
            \item Plot a histogram for 
    \end{enumerate}

    \item {[20 points]} 
    Apply SVMs to the problem:
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item Separate the training data into a $k$-fold cross validation testing framework for $k$=10. 
    	\item Train SVM models using your validation framework. Try a few different kernels. What kernel yields the best performance?
	\item Apply your best model to the testing set. Report your classification accuracy. 
    \end{enumerate}

    \item {[25 points]} 
    Apply a (simple) deep neural net to the problem:
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item Construct a deep neural network (layers? convolution?)
	\item Train your model. Report your performance on the training data.
	\item Apply your model to the testing set. Report your classification accuracy. 
    \end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
